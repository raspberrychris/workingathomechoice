# How attitudes to working from home are changing

**You only have to read the news this week in the UK to to see lots of influencial websites are again covering the topic of Working from Home.**

The **[BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54886125)**, **[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/18/working-from-home-living-coronavirus-remote)** and **[Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/11/19/google-employees-productive-working-home/)** all covered the topic of working from home in the last two days showing how popular a topic it is becoming, and that the demand for such content is increasing.

For some people they have been working at home for 9 months and now are only just working or planning out how they can work at home *effectively*.  **Working from home comes with its own challenges** and it is not all plain sailing as some people would lead you to believe.  Maintaining your **mental health** whilst working from home is very important, as is keeping on top of your general health and fitness, and also ensuring you eat well.  

The people who have thrived at working from home are the ones that make time for managing these aspects of working from home.

## No clear end in sight for the Corona Virus

With the Corona Virus Pandemic many people naturally assumed there would be an end point where things would go back to normal during this year.  Unfortunately that wasn't to be so, and as such some people didn't take the appropriate steps to set up their home working space correctly.

## Working from home will become the norm

Now the realisation for many is that working from home will become the new norm for certain types of jobs.  Some [companies such as Google](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/11/19/google-employees-productive-working-home/) are even finding that their e**mployees are more productive working from home**.  If people are more productive and happier on the whole when working from home, why are we stressing ourselves out on our nightmare commutes into the city when we could work from home in a more controllable environment: Your Home.  

## Google a data company is saying that WFH is more productive for its employees

If Google, the company that has data at its core of its business, that monitors all of data on its various search offerings is saying that its employees are more productive whilst working from home, doesn't it seem likely that working from home could actually **benefit all of us** in the long term?  *Not necessarily* - What works for Google might work for some companies, but it does entirely depend on the job sector.  It is now clear though that there were a lot of myths about working from home and these are reinforced by our own popular culture.  Even an episode of The Simpsons portrays Homer as working from home, putting on weight, not dressing properly and generally portraying a previous stereotype of WFH as being "easy" compared to an office job.

## Can WFH be better than office life?

For some people in the UK working from home hasn't been a lifestyle choice, but now many are coming round to the fact that working from home is actually a positive change for people in the long term and they have also realised that they would like to find a way to do more of this in the long term!  

Our [Passive income methods](https://workathomechoice.com/how-to-make-passive-income/) pages on this website will show you how you can start to support yourself completely from an online, passive income.  The good news is that it is now 100% possible to do this, the bad news is it is still a lot of work and there are no quick methods to do this.

## Is there a mental health issue around working from home?

The BBC took a topical approach by considering the mental health impact of WFH. (With the assumption that many people aren't enjoying it). ["how to be happier while working from home"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54886125).  The article covered what are seemingly fairly basic things such as "Let in the light" and eating well.

## The Government wants you go to go back to the office ultimately

One of the issues for the Government is that WFH means that cities in particular, London, that thrive on office workers trade will now suffer as a result of this change.  [The Guardian reported in August](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/28/media-blitz-to-get-workers-back-to-offices-amid-pandemic) that there were fears that city centres would become "ghost towns".  [Essentialretail.com](https://www.essentialretail.com/news/uk-consumers-shift-online/) reported that **17.2m UK consumers would be expected to shift online as a result of Corona Virus**.  While this is good news for online shops, this is not good news for smaller, more traditional shops and the city that don't have an online presence.

## You have to do what is best for you

Those who have been able to work from home during lockdowns have had a preview of what it is like.  Let's be clear - Working from home is not for everyone, but I think for a certain group of people that felt like they didn't have a choice before, there is now an opportunity, thanks to the internet to start your own business work from home and become successful.

You only have to look at some of the entrepreneurs on **Etsy** who were selling handmade masks at the beginning of the Pandemic to see that anyone who is willing to step outside of their comfort zone a little bit has the potential to make money from their home on a more permanent basis and become self-sufficient.  The [Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/etsy-sales-lifted-by-demand-for-face-masks-11603925874) that Etsy sold 24 million masks in September quarter and Etsy itself more than doubled its revenue.
