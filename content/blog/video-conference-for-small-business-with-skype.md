## Video Conference Calls & Small Business Phone Services From Skype

When a small business needs to save money, business trips can be one of the first casualties of entrepreneurial budget cuts. Reducing business-related travel is a simple way to save money for small business owners, but can also reduce business opportunities.

Learn to use Skype for video conference calls and small business phone services, and continue networking without paying for meals, hotels and transportation.

## Video Conference Calls With Skype

To make a phone or video conference call using the Skype software, both sides need some basic computer equipment. It’s a good idea to have everything set up prior to the meeting, to provide a more productive experience for both parties.

- Broadband Internet Connection - In order to make an Internet phone call or video call, Skype needs a robust Internet connection. With a low speed connection, such as dial-up, users will experience drop-outs in the audio, and freezing images in the video. The faster the connection is, the better the audio and video will be for both callers.

- Functioning Computer, including a monitor - Skype works equally well on laptops, netbooks and PCs, but a larger monitor provides a better visual experience during video conferencing.

- Audio Equipment - A microphone and speakers should be available for group meetings, in which a number of people will be offering input, but a headset is a better choice for a one-on-one meeting. Many headsets offer noise-canceling features, which prevents environmental noises from interfering with the conference.

## What to Expect During an Internet Video Conference

To initiate a Skype video or phone conference, select the Skype ID of the person or group that will be participating in the call. If the person is online, and ready to receive the call, the ID will show a green check-mark. After selecting the name of the call recipient, the initiating caller should click on the green “Call” button for a teleconference, or “Video Call” for a video conference. Once the receiving side answers the call, the conference can begin. There is no time-limit or charge for Skype-to-Skype audio calls or video calls, so continue the conference until all business is concluded.


## Using Internet Video Calls to Save Money

Whether a small business is trying to coordinate operations between multiple locations, or discuss expansion with a long-distance investor, video calls can save money. By using the Internet for virtual face-to-face meetings, small businesses can reduce travel expenses while improving relationships with investors and clients.
