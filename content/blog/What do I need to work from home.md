# What Do I Need to work From Home?  (Guide for employees)

**In terms of equipment you will need a good quality office chair, a desk or something to work on.  If you suffer from a bad back it might be worth investing in a cushion that enables a good posture to protect your back from getting strained.

## Choosing a good office chair for working from Home

When I was faced with the prospect of working from home it was very tempting just to stay in bed all day and not exert any energy at all.  If you have been working for many years this may be appealing but it is not the best decision for your health.  Investing in a good quality office chair will make all the difference and will make you want to **get up** in the morning to go to work.  A lot of work places invest considerable sums of money into making their office workable for employees. This involves eliminating any chances of getting eye strain, by using specific lighting arrangements and also investing in good quality chairs and monitors if it is an office job.

##  Choosing a good back support for your office chair when working from Home

Finding the perfect back support for when you are working from home is very essential if you have any history of back pain.  Unlike the office unless you have a special setup at home then you may find that you really need to invest in a good professional level back support.


## How to get the money for the working from home equipment

Buying equipment for working from home can be expensive if you don't own any of the equipment.  If you are lucky you may be able to ask your company that you are working for to provide you with some money to buy these items.  If you are working for yourself then you are likely not to have that option, but making the right choices on your working from home setup early on will save you money in the longterm.  If you have been asked to work from home at all this year then you can claim just over Â£100 from HMRC.
