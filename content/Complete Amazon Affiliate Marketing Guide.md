# Complete Amazon Affiliate Marketing Guide

**Welcome to the complete Amazon Affiliate marketing guide!  This guide will guide you through step by step on how to get started making money with the Amazon Affiliates scheme.  This guide is written from a UK perspective but the same principles apply to other countries where Amazon run an affiliates scheme**

## What is the Amazon Associates Program?

![amazon-affiliates-image-laptop](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599153066743-08810dc8a419?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=967&q=80)

Amazon's affiliate program is a pay for referral program that gives users of its affiliate scheme a commission for every instance a referral from your site enables them to get a sale on Amazon.  In essence, if a visitor to your site clicks a link that refers a user to an Amazon product and then subsequently buys that product, that means that you as the website owner will get a percentage of that sale.  Sounds great right?  That's because it is!  As we all are aware Amazon has gone from strength to strength in recent years and now sells almost anything you can imagine.  Commissions for items vary, so it is important to understand the commission rate before jumping into a specific niche.

## How does Amazon's affiliate program compare to other affiliate programs out there?

Anyone who works on Amazon affiliates for the majority of their income would admit that the majority of the commissions for Amazon products are very low compared to many other affiliate programs.  Part of the beauty of Amazon affiliate though is that you get a commission for everything someone buys on their shop (for qualifying products), not just the product you referred.  This means that the earning potential is a little bit bigger than the commissions would suggest.

## How does Amazon’s affiliate program work?

So how exactly does Amazon's affiliate program work?  Well, it is very simple really:  You sign up at https://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/ or https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/ for (US).  Once you have signed up you will have to enter your site details and your category that you will market in.  You will then need to get a commission within a set period to keep your account.

![amazon-share-price](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554260570-e9689a3418b8?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1360&q=80)

- One of the big **Pros** around the Amazon affiliate marketing program is the size of the offering.  Amazon has one of the **largest product catalogues** in the world.  That is a fairly big pro!  This means that you can set up an Amazon Affiliate site around pretty much any niche and make it your own.  

- The **Cons** are that there is **no quick way** to success with Amazon Affiliate.  It takes time.  If you already have a platform that is getting considerable traffic then monetising that traffic shouldn't be that difficult, but if you are starting from scratch then you may find some difficulty in getting started with affiliate.

- The **Commissions are also fairly low** for certain categories and Amazon have actually lowered their commission rates this year much to the annoyance of amazon affiliates around the world.  Amazon's commission structure depends on which territory you are an affiliate for.  The UK commissions are listed below.
